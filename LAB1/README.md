# MIDPS LAB #1

# Connection and Set Up Server and Environments

As a server in this laboratory work I used virtual machine with Mac OS X, because it is easier to set up ssh connection at this platform.

After connection to virtual machine I installed Xcode comand line tools in order to use git, and after this I created an empty repo for all MIDPS labs, because I didn't observe a sample projects of Hello World programs at repo with labs requirements, I wrote these programs by myself, and after this I compiled and executed this 2 sample programs using `gcc` and `python`.

Intersting fact is that I spent much less time in comparision with my colleagues, and especially with my colleague with Arch Linux, for set up a ssh connection and virtual machine, because I used Mac OS, (not a MacBook), operation system for perfoming this laboratory work. I have installed it also on my laptop(Yes, I am an Idiot).

# Git Experience

Having the repo for LAB #1, with command `git checkout -b "branch_name"` I created 2 branches, one is named c and second is python. These branches contain sample Hello World Programs written in corresponding language, they are used for perfoming neccessary git commands.

- ## Setting a branch to track a remote origin
Using command `git branch -u remote/branch_name` I set branch python to track remote origin in this way.
