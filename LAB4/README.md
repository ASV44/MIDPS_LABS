# MIDPS LAB #4

# Set up Work Process

As last laboratory work, I want to present the MVP of "HackWall" project, which was developed by our team at 'Garage48'. The goal of project 
was to create a recruiter and hackathons aggregator. This project should include a strong back-end which could provides testing of 
project uploaded on server and intuitive interface with standart front-end part.

The original repo of project is located [here](https://github.com/strdr4605/garage48-2017) and the MVP can be seen [here](hackwall.devasid.com)
, and at creation of MVP the biggest part with which I have worked was UI and creation of html pages.

# Work Experience

The whole user interface was build **without** Bootstrap but was used much more interesting thing which is **Flexbox**, this is very usefful tool
for layout construction, and this was something new what I have learned from this project.

Also in this project is not used direct CSS, but SASS whihc is complied in CSS, in order to do this, is used Gulp which manages all this stuff.
The big part of my work experience in this project was work with landing pages, and this work was really interesting because of using new tools
and features which I haven't use before.

# Conclusion
Work at this project gives me knowledge about new technologies and using these it is possible to improve skills of fast and fun, web development.
Also I have studied how to work with web project, how to initialize and test it, and how to work in case when you don't have IDE but only
a text editor.
